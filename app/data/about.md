#### Intro
I am a junior software engieer at HBB Inc. where I work on building an app to connect users from around the world.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusivity, and nature. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Los Angeles but am always available over Zoom/Skype/FaceTime.
<br><br>
#### Currently
At HBB Inc. I have learned how to work in a team environment and build iOS based user profiles. I've also learned how to build and maintain large phone applications.

#### Some history

- In 2004 I would use my father's PC just to play games.

- In the summer of 2005, my parents bought me a PS2 and the first game I had was GTA. I might have endangered my education by using it too much.

- My parents let me pick out my first laptop in 2010 and I chose a Toshiba just because it could play 3D movies. My favorite movies were Like Mike, Slumdog Millionaire, and Iron Man. To this day, I still don't know how to turn on the 3D mode.

- I didn't get over 10mbps download speed until I was a senior in high school in 2013. I now get over 500mbps.

- At 12, I discovered I could play online with my friends on Playstation and almost failed 7th grade.

- When I was 13 I competed in my first FIFA tournament. I lost in the second round.

- In 9th grade I got to travel to England as part of the Arsenal soccer school and compete against youth teams from the Premier League.

- At 15, I got my one and only detention for secretly putting a few drips of water on everyone's chair. I was the only one with dry pants.

- At 16, I went to summer camp at the University of California: Los Angeles (UCLA) and fell in love. I went back the next year and promised myself that I'd go to college here. I've since graduated with two degrees from UCLA.

- During my second year of college, I spent too much money on sneakers and realized I had to sell them or not eat. I started finding hard to get shoes for my friends that they would pay a premium for and ended up making a small (unofficial) business out of it.

- At 21, I worked with software engineers for the first time at Snap Inc. This got me thinking about pursuing a career change.

- At 23, I built my first website with React. My website was terrible.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

#### Travel / Geography

- I am from originally from Cairo, Egypt however I was born in Boston, Massachusetts. I have since lived in Manama, Bahrain and Los Angeles, California.

- Although I lived in Bahrain, an island smaller than the size of LA, for 18 years, I was not able to pick up the local dialect.

- I've been to about 25 countries, some of which I have forgotten, and many of which I would like to revisit.

- My favorite country - so far - is the Maldives.

- I went to Barcelona for my senior trip and have been eating paella ever since.

- When I visit my family in Egypt I plan layovers so that I can spend a day touring a new city usually in Europe.

- The next country I plan to visit: Japan.
